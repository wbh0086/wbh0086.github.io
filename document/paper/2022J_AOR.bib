abstract = {Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is one of the critical design considerations for the offshore riser and pipeline system. Significant research effort has been devoted to better understanding and predicting riser VIV. Compared to the bare uniform riser configuration, the attached staggered buoyancy modules of a small aspect ratio will extensively alter riser hydrodynamic characters, and hence the riser dynamic response. In the current study, experiments were performed on forced inline (IL)-crossflow (CF) combined vibration of a rigid cylinder with staggered modules (module to bare cylinder diameter and length ratio of 2.5 and 1.0.) as well as self-induced vibration of two flexible models with 100% and 50% buoyancy module coverage ratios. From the rigid model experiment, positive regions for lift coefficient in the phase of velocity (Clv) for both riser and buoyancy module induced vibration are observed. The result indicates potential power-in excitation from both riser and buoyancy modules, which is later confirmed by the bi-frequency and bi-modal vibration from the flexible cylinder experiment. Furthermore, several other phenomena have been reported, including low reduced frequency for buoyancy module induced motion, the phase between CF and IL trajectory, and buoyancy module VIV suppression ability, emphasizing the connection between the rigid and flexible cylinder experiment.}
